## Automating the Really Boring Stuff for Topo or Background Maps

### 1. First you must download your DEM's from the internet.

I usually use either Earth Explorer or WebGIS

### 2. Put the Unzipped Files inside the same folder that you put this script into

### 3. Either Change the environment settings in the first couple of lines or name your folder Final_Proj
